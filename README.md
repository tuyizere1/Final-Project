- **MySQL** (v5.7 or higher)
- **npm** (usually comes with Node.js)

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd community-health-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Database Setup

#### Create MySQL Database
```sql
CREATE DATABASE community_health;
```

#### Run Database Schema
Execute the SQL commands from the `database-schema.sql` file (located in the project root) in your MySQL client:

```bash
mysql -u your_username -p community_health < database-schema.sql
```

### 4. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=your_mysql_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
DB_NAME=community_health

# JWT Secret
JWT_SECRET=your_very_secure_jwt_secret_key_here

# Server Port
PORT=3000
```

### 5. Start the Application

#### Development Mode
```bash
npm run dev
```

#### Production Mode
```bash
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Database Schema

### Users Table
Stores user authentication and role information
- `id`, `username`, `email`, `password`, `role`, `created_at`, `updated_at`

### Reports Table
Main table for health issue reports
- `id`, `user_id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `category`, `priority`, `status`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `image_url`, `created_at`, `updated_at`

### Report Updates Table
Tracks comments and status changes on reports
- `id`, `report_id`, `user_id`, `comment`, `status_change`, `created_at`

##  API Endpoints

### Authentication Routes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Error**
   - Verify MySQL is running
   - Check `.env` file credentials
   - Ensure database exists

2. **Authentication Issues**

   - Check JWT secret in `.env`
   - Verify user exists in database

3. **Port Already in Use**
   - Change PORT in `.env` file
   - Kill existing process: `npx kill-port 3000`

### Logs
- Check console for error messages
- Monitor MySQL query logs if needed
- Use browser developer tools for frontend issues
